# Notes - Mastering Bitcoin 

Welcome to my notes on *Mastering Bitcoin* by Andreas M. Antonopoulos, a technical guide to understanding Bitcoin and blockchain technology. 

From the experiences I have had with learning new things, I have learnt that the best way _for me_ to master a topic is to be conscious of my thoughts and be present while learning. And writing my thoughts down as I am learning helps me to understand the topic better.

So, if writing down things keeps me focused _and helps me understand the topic better_, I thought why not share my notes with others? Maybe it'll help others better understand different topics.  

And hence, I started this repository.
